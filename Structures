//DECLARING A STRUCTURE

Structure is typically declared with level numbers used to "next" substructures
The structure can contain nested structures like (element_data)
Only the leaf elements (like element_forward and element_value) contain data attributes
Newer way to declare structures are "type" structures

dcl
  1 element,
    2 element_forward  pointer,
    2 element_data union,
      3 element_value  fixed bin(31),
      3 element_bits   bit(32) aligned;


//Unions can be defined by the attribute union after the name, or * for unnamed union 
  Unions give you 2 different views of those bytes

//Summing Values in a linked list

//REFERRING TO AN ELEMENT IN A STRUCTURE

Do not always need to be fully qualified
But must be unambigious



//Routine to sum the values in linked list

  sumthem: proc( list ) returns(fixed bin(31) );

  dcl list    pointer;
  dcl total   fixed bin(31);
  dcl next    pointer;

  total = 0;
  next = list;
  do while( next <> sysnull() );
    total += next->element_value;
    next = next->element_forward;
  end;
  return( total );
end;
