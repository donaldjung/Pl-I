//BASED WITH REFER
  A based structure in PL/I can use the REFER attribute to define an array
  with non-constant bounds

  The SIZE field is used only when the arrray is allocated

  Any other references to the structure will use the LEN field to determine  
  the current upper bound for the array

  dcl
    1 vector    based,
      2 len     fixed bin(15),
      2 array( size refer(len) ) fixed bin(31);

 Have to add ALLOCATE statement after.                //allocate storage 
 Have to add FREE statement after all moves made.     //free storage
