//For arithmetic, PL/I has precise rules to keep as many fractional digits as possible

//Addition and Subtraction

//The result P and Q are calculated by:
      dec(p1,q1) + dec(p2,q2) 
      Q = max(q1,q2)
      P = 1 + max(p1-q1,p2-q2) + Q 

//Multiplication
    Q = q1 + q2
    P = 1 + p1 + p2 

//Divide
