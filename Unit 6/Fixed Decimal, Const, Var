//FIXED DECIMAL CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES

//FIXED DECIMAL CONSTANTS
//A fixed decimal constant is a literal containing a sequence of p digits with q digits after a decimal
        fixed dec(p,q)
  12 is fixed dec(2,0)
 .05 is fixed dec(2,2)    //Can use _ to help readability i.e 123_456_789 = 123456789

//FIXED DECIMAL VARIABLES
//Declared with type fixed dec
//In storage a fixed dec vairable has 2 digits per nibble, rightmost nibble is C or D (neg var)
  100C = 100
  100D = -100

//P must be between 0 and 31, this is the precision
//Q must be btween 0 and p, this is the scale factor (decimals)
fixed dec(p,q) 

//In storage 12345C and 123.45C is the same, but the scale factor adjusts via multiply 10^(-q)
