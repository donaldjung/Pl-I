  //DEFAULT STORAGE CLASSES IN PL/I
  EITHER STATIC OR AUTOMATIC
  //PACKAGE-LEVEL STORAGE CLASSES
  In PL/I, package-level variables (what C called file scope variables) default to static
  //PROCEDURE-LEVEL STORAGE CLASSES 
  Procedure level variables default to automatic (automatic storage)

  //AUTOMATIC STORAGE
  Can explicitly specify that a variable is to be in automatic storage,
  with automatic attribute (auto)
  You CANNOT specify auotmatic attribute on the package-level variable
  Automatic must referred to storage inside a function and lives in the function

  //CONSTANT STORAGE
  Can specify a name having the VALUE attribute
  Cannot specify as another storage attribute as welll
  Compiler will decide if it assigns such a name to constant storage but,
  you cannot take their storage

  //STATIC STORAGE
  You can explicity speciy that a variable i to be in static storage via 
  STATIC attribute
  Works on package-level variable OR,
  procedure-level variable 
  ***THE STATIC ATTRIBUTE SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR VARIABLES WOSE VALUES MUST 
      BE RESERVED ACCROSS CALLS***
      THIS IS BECAUSE ITS MAKES THE COMPILER LESS LIKELY TO ASSIGN VARIABLE TO REGISTER
      CAUSING LESS EFFICIENT CODE 

  //NON-ASSIGNABLE STATIC
  If you want to take the address of a constant
      Change the attribute value to init
      Add the attributes nonasgn static
  The compiler will then assign storage (read-only) to the constants
  but flag any assignments/changes to it
