//FLOATING POINT DECLARES
  Able to declare floating-point variables as binary or decimal
  The precision indicates how many digits it will have if converted to decimal,
  or character, and also its size.
//FLOAT DECIMAL
  1-6 single precision
  7-16 double precision
  17 <= quad precision 
//FLOAT BINARY
  1 <= precision <= 21     single precision
  22 <= precision <= 53    double precision
  54 <= precision          quad precision (long double)

//PLATFORM REPRESENTATION 
  z/OS used to only have hexadecimal float
  Now supports IEEE binary float and IEEE decimal float standards
  ***Differ in their base, (2, 10, 16 ==> binary, decimal, hexa floats)
                                          Also exponent range
