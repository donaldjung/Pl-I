//COMPARISONS
//String comparisons are of the underlying byte value
//ASCII different than EBCDIC
//Shorter strings are extended with blanks 

//ASSIGNMENTS
//If source is longer than the max length of target, source is truncated
//If target is declared as varying or varying4, the length field is set
//If target is declared as varyingz, 0x0 will be appended
//If target is declared as nonvarying, blanks appended as needed

//CONCATENATE-ASSIGN / APPEND
str ||= str2;

//BUILT IN FUNCTIONS
//Do not need to be declared
//Often have self-evident names and are frequently overloaded 
//Some examples: 
    length(str)            //return length
    maxlength(str)         //return max length 
    copy( 'a',2 )          //return n copies of str
    hex( str )             //returns str in hex 
    substr( str, c, n )    //return substring of str at char c for n characters 
    trim( str )            //trim leading/trailing blanks

//returns 0 if not found 
    index(str1, str2 )     //finds first occurence of entire string str2 in str1
    search(str1, str2 )    //finds first character in str1 that is in str2 
    verify(str1, str2 )    //finds first character in x that is not in y 
    indexr, searchr, verifyr //does the same but starts from the right 

//BIT VARIABLES 
//nonvarying, varying and varying4 attributes are all valid for bit variables
//varyingz is not
//length is number of bits 

//UTF variables
//You can declare string variables with type uchar or wchar
//Type uchar holds UTF-8 and wchar UTF-16
//Length is number of UTF-8 or UTF-16 "characters"
