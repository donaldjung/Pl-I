//PACKAGE STATEMENT 
//First statement in source should be package statement
//Each package statement should have matching end statement 
//No statements can follow the Package End statement 

//PROCEDURE STATEMENT
//If you want more 'sister' procedure, enclose it in the package statement 
//'sister' procedure can share declarations
//Can choose which procedures will be visable outside package 

//***You can have no package statement if all code is done in one procedure, but this isn't done in
//***production, rather making quick code. 
//All executable code must be enclosed by a procedure-end group, similar to {} in C
//Name of function defined by label (sample: ) on procedure statement

//MAIN FUNCTIONS
//The options( main ) clause idntifies this procedure as the main
//ONLY ONE procedure can specify options( main )

//END STATEMENT
//Can include the name of procedure it closes (also true for package statement)
//Good programming will include names for end statements to help match end statements with proc/pack

 hello: package;
  ... 
    sample:
      procedure options( main );
      ...
      end sample;
  end;
