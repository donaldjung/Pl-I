//SEARCHING FOR A CHARACTER IN A SET
  In PL/I built in function search will find the first occurence in a string
  of any character in a set -- starting at a specified index into the string

  Here we look for the first occurence of any delimeters

//SEARCHING FOR A CHARACTER NOT IN A SET
  In PL/I the built in function VERIFY will find the first occurence
  in a string of any character NOT in a set -- starting at specified index

  next = search( source, ' ,.', start );
  
  Here we look for the first occurence of any character that is not one of the
  delimiters in ' ,.'
  
  start = verify( source, ' ,.', next );

//SPLICING A STRING OUT OF A LONGER STRING
  The PL/I function substr will extract a substring from a larger string
  at a specified index

  Substring consists of either:
    All the characters starting from the specified index
    OR
    A specified (here: next-start) number of chars starting from that index

    table(words) = substr(source,start);            //substring from source, at "start" to end
    table(words) = substr(source,start,next-start); //substring from source at "start" + length
