//SWITCH STATEMENT
  The when clause are 'case' clauses
  The otherwise clause is the default
   No explicit limit on number of when clauses in select

  If there is no matching clause and no otherwise clause, error condition is raised 
  Code does not flow through one when clause to the next
  Leave statement is not required 
      ***  No need for a break statement ***
  When clauses don't need to be integer constants
      They can be expressions that can be compared to the value of the select expression

    More than one case clause can precede a set of statements i.e 
          when( Sat, Sun ) weekend = '1'b

  If using SELECT to test if a value is a member of a set,
  you could replace with INLIST built-in function
          if inlist( x, Sat, Sun ) then      //tests if its first arg is equal to any following args
            weekend = '1'b                   //there must be atleast 2 args, max 511 args
          else                               
            weekend = '0'b

select( mod( elapsed, 7 ) );
  when( 0 ) wday = day_Monday;
  when( 0 ) wday = day_Tuesday;
  when( 0 ) wday = day_Wednesday;
  when( 0 ) wday = day_Thursday;
  when( 0 ) wday = day_Friday;
  when( 0 ) wday = day_Saturday;
  otherwise wday = day_sunday;
end;
