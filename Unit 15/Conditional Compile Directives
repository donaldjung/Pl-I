//CONDITIONAL COMPILATION DIRECTIVES
Used to choose what source code to compile

  %if-%then-%else statement 
    ***The source to be compiled in(or out) has to be enclosed in %do and %end statements
      %if test = 1 %then %do;  
        put skip list( "some text" );
      %end

// %SELECT STATEMENTS 
    Instead of nesting %if statements you can use %select
      May be dominated or undominated ( %select, %when(...)...)


// %XDECLARE , exclusive declare
  SYSPTRSIZE , check what addressing and define based on addressing mode 

  %Do-%end, allows %leave and %iterate, can be nested 
      *%do skip   //all code from a %do skip to %end will be ignored 
                  //useful for commenting out code containing comments that you dont wish to delete
