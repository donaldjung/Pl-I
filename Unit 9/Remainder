//REMAINDER BUILT-IN FUNCTION
  Remainders can be negative

  rem( x, y )
  rem( 10, 8 ) = 2
  rem( -10, 8 ) = -2

//MOD BUILD-IN FUNCTION
  Mod is never negative: it is the smallest non-negative value R such that (x - R) is exactly divisable  
  by y
  If x is non-negative and y is a constant power of 2, then the compiler will turn mod(x,y) into a faster
  iand(x,y-1)
  mod( x, y )
  mod( 10, 8 ) = 2
  mod( -10, 8 ) = 6
