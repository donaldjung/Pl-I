//DO WHILE
  Must have matching end statement
  *You can use LEAVE statement to exit the loop or ITERATE statement to branch back to the do while
  Condition Clause checked BEFORE each iteration

//DO UNTIL
  The loop gets run AT LEAST ONCE 
  Condition Clause checked AFTER each iteration

//CAN CONBINE DO WHILE UNTIL
  Can even combine with iterative do loops
  
  example.
  do jx = 1 to 20 
     while( next <> sysnull() )
     until( next = target);
    total += next->element_value;
    next = next->element_forward
  end;
